The drive roller moves the ULD across the cargo compartment until it engages in the YZ-latches and YZ-guide rails which stop it. The drive roller below the ULD turns until the joystick is released and goes back to the center/neutral position. Thus the power supply to the lateral PDU is stopped and causes the drive roller to go down.</br>To move the ULD in the ball mat area to the rear of the cargo compartment, push the joystick to the AFT position and hold it. Power is supplied to all of the longitudinal PDU; this causes their rollers to turn and the drive roller to come up.

The roller of the longitudinal PDU turn until the joystick is released and goes back to the center/neutral position. The XZ latches keep the ULD aligned while the ULD moves into the loading position. When the ULD is in position, you lift the XZ single latch 32 in front of it manually to hold the ULD. When you lift the XZ single latch 32, the proximity switch below the latch operates and stops the power supply to the related PDU. The PDU is now isolated from the power supply.
