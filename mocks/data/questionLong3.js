It includes two main components:</br>- The HP bleed valve</br>- The IP bleed check valve</br>This sub-system bleeds the air from the intermediate or higher stages of the compressor depending on the available pressure and engine speeds as follows:</br>- In the normal engine air bleed configuration, the air is bled from the compressor IP port (intermediate pressure, on the 5th stage) at high engine speed.</br>- At low engine speeds, especially during aircraft descents, with engine at idle, the IP port pressure is insufficient. The air is automatically bled from the port (high pressure on the 9th stage) through the HP bleed valve and the pressure downstream of this valve causes the IP bleed check valve to close.</br>- When the IP port pressure exceeds the HP bleed valve target value, the HP bleed valve closes. Air bleed transfer from the HP port to the IP port is pneumatically achieved. Air is directly bled from the IP stage through the IP bleed check valve.</br>There are three cases of pneumatic operation:</br>- HP stage pressure lower than 35 psig (average valve):</br>Air is bled from the HP port through the HP bleed valve which is fully open. The IP bleed check valve is closed to prevent any air recirculation through the engine.</br>- HP stage pressure higher than 35 psig and lower than 100 psig, and IP stage pressure lower than 35 psig:</br>Air is bled from the HP port through the HP bleed valve which regulates the downstream pressure at 35 psig. The IP bleed check valve is closed to prevent any air recirculation.</br>- IP stage pressure higher than 35 psig:</br>If the solenoid of the HP bleed valve is not energized, air bleed transfer from the HP port to the IP port is pneumatically achieved. The IP bleed check valve is open.</br>NOTE: Transfer to the IP stage can be forced by closing the HP bleed valve via a solenoid incorporated in the valve.
